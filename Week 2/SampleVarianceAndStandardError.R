##Sample variance is also an random variable, wich expectation of desired result
##Var_sample use divide n-1 to form unbiased estimator

##sample variance is estimation of population variance
##distribution of sample variance has expectation of population variance
##variance of sample mean is signal^2 /n

##standard error: sigma / root(n)
