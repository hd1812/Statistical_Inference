##Law of large numbers in action, coin flip
means<-cumsum(sample(0:1,n,replace=TRUE))/(1:n)

##The Central Limit Theorem
##distribution of averages of iid variables of iid variable
##becomes that of a standard normal as sample size increases

##Galton's quincunx
##Average of Binomial distributions to mimic Gaussian shape
