####Week 1 Introduction

##Useful concepts
##PMF,PDF -- discrete and contineous
##cpf, quantile, survival -- complimentary


##Code Sample
##pbeta(0.75,2,1) --0.75 quantile with triangle height 2, width 1

##Probability model connects data to population using assumptions
##Most statistical terms are estimands

####Conditional Probability
##Sentivity +D   Specivicity -Dc  prevalance (P(D))(popularity)

##Likelihood ratio
##P(D|+)/P(Dc|+) => P(+|D)/P(+|Dc) * P(D)/P(Dc)
##Post-test odds=> DLR+ * Pre-test odds
##DLR (Diagnostic Likelihood ratio)

##Independence
##P(A^B)=P(A)P(B) only when AB are independent

##Expected values
##Popultaion mean is estimated by sample mean
##sample code: manimupate

##Sample average itself is random variable, more centerred around population mean
##Expected value of sample is same as population mean if estimator is un  biased
